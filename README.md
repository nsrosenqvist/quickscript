quickscript
===========

QuickScript is my personal BASH-framework for fast script development - less worry about input, error handling and logging, more creativity.

This is a work in progress, I'm adding as long as I go and if you want something to use as a base for all your future BASH projects then you should probably wait until 1.0.
