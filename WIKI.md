QuickScript is a small BASH-framework for fast script development - less worry about input, error handling and logging, more creativity.

Features include logging functions, script instance management, and a custom getopts alternative, **qs_opts**, which is not as performant but a whole lot more flexible. It supports both long and short options, option groups, option aliases and different syntax for assigning values. It also includes input from the command line, pipes and files and abstracting it away from the user.

Below you can view all the documented features.
